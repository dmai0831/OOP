Objects are Reference Types

int i;
i = 35;

int j = i;
j = 3;

what is the value of i?
output i = 35
--------------------

var cust1 = new Customer();
cust1.FirstName = "AA";

var cust2 = cust1;
cust2.FirstName = "BB";

what is cust1.FirstName?
output BB because both of them are pointing to the same Customer object
--------------------

When compare 2 objects, if they are referencing the same object, they would consider the same.
If they are two separate objects but are matching the properties, they are not considering to be equal.

Abstract class cannot be instantiated


--------
Static class cannot be instantiated. Meaning you cannot use the "new" keyword to create the object.
